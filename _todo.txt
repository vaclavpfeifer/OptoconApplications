- implement logging
  ~ do wrapper over another engine so we can switch

- convert project to makefile or QTproj file or Cmake?
  ~ to have same basic settings (to not export qt proj every time some change to vcxproj is made)
  

- add architecture design 
  ~ e.g. high level class diagram in EA?


- testing solution
  ~ unit vs. integration tests
  ~ selection of testing engine (have previous experience with google test)
  ~ define use cases


- Migrate to cross-platfrom development
  ~ ideally build for selected platform - directly on win, or indirectly by sending data and invoking compile & link on target platform


- Deployment process
  ~ distribute source binary with only necessary QT libs?
  ~ 


- Architecture:
  ~ create items in Abstract View for all items that could exists and do move the common logic to abstract class which should now work with local variables from abstract class.
    The only thing that must be done is registration in concrete view class + before setting/do some action test must be performed that concrete item has been set...
    + make method virtual so they could be override in case of need
    
     ~ do the check that items exists at the beggining or on the fly? Or switch to std::map!!!
